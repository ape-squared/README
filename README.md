### Hey, I'm Ape 👋🏾

I'm a 21 year old backend developer and system administrator. I like to write reliable code and play with different open-sourced software.

Interested in scaling software, complex UI and UX, network engineering and gorillas, of course.

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working on [LanCache](https://lancache.net) - With LanCache, you can achieve global low-latency content delivery for any gaming deployed directly from Azure, Paperspace and other VPS providers. It's super easy – just push our servers, and we'll automatically handle new rollouts. 🚀

## ⚡️ Experience

I like to say that I'm a backend developer, though I'm mostly experienced in system administration. I highly leverage [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) to build scalable realtime systems, and I pair that with React on the frontend. I've been working with React for about 2 years, Kotlin for almost 4, and JavaScript for more than 5 years.
